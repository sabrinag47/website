```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{R}
library(reticulate)
hi<-"Hello"

```

```{python}
hi="world"
print(r.hi,hi)
```

```{R}
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
```

*Python and R are very both very useful and have similar languages but they each have their benefits.*
*While the languages are distinct they can be used concurrently and be used to solve one problem.*
*I find it interesting how python can organize large amounts of information and quantify it. An example of this would be the study of DNA nucleotides.*
*By using Python, it becomes easier to determine differences between sequences and how they are aligned with each other.*

```{python}
my_seq="ATCATCATG"

import re
re.findall(r"\w\w\w",my_seq)
```
*The example above shows how easy it is to observe 3-mers in a DNA sequence. This is particularly useful when wanting to know DNA sequences to observe amino acids and protein structures.*
